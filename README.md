# Wormhole Visualization and Optimization Tool

![study](https://github.com/HermiTech-LLC/BHmetrics_WHsim/blob/main/BhWh.PNG)
__________________________________
## Overview
This tool integrates theoretical physics concepts with interactive data visualization and optimization techniques. It's built with Dash for web-based interaction, Plotly for visualization, NumPy for numerical operations, Waitress as a server, and Scikit-Optimize for Bayesian optimization.

## Features
- Enhanced Morris-Thorne Metric Calculation
- Interactive 3D Visualization
- Parameter Sliders for real-time adjustment
- Bayesian Optimization for optimal parameters
- Display of optimization results

  *note: the feasability function should be improved for accurate comparisons to an accurate model of logical physics fitting to, extending or proposing an empirically validated model of physics.*
