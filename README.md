# Wormhole Visualization and Optimization Tool

## Overview
This tool integrates theoretical physics concepts with interactive data visualization and optimization techniques. It's built with Dash for web-based interaction, Plotly for visualization, NumPy for numerical operations, Waitress as a server, and Scikit-Optimize for Bayesian optimization.

## Features
- Enhanced Morris-Thorne Metric Calculation
- Interactive 3D Visualization
- Parameter Sliders for real-time adjustment
- Bayesian Optimization for optimal parameters
- Display of optimization results

## Installation
To set up the tool, ensure that you have Python 3.6 or later installed on your system. Then install the required dependencies using `pip`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the script to start the web application:
```bash
python wormhole_app.py
```
